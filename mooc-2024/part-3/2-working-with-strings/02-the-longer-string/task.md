Please write a program which asks the user for two strings and then prints out whichever is the longer of the two - that is, whichever has the more characters. If the strings are of equal length, the program should print out "The strings are equally long".

Some examples of expected behaviour:

Please type in string 1: hey
Please type in string 2: hiya
hiya is longer

Please type in string 1: howdy doody
Please type in string 2: hola
howdy doody is longer

Please type in string 1: hey
Please type in string 2: bye
The strings are equally long
